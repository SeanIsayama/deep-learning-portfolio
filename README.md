# Deep Learning Portfolio

This portfolio showcases deep learning projects completed for CSE 151B: Deep Learning at UC San Diego (Winter 2025). Each project includes a detailed PDF report summarizing objectives, methods, results, and reflections.

Unless otherwise noted, all projects were completed in a collaborative team of four students:
- **Hikaru Isayama**
- **Avi Mehta**
- **Wilson Liao**
- **Julia Wong**

> 🔒 Code available upon request due to academic integrity policy (group coursework).
